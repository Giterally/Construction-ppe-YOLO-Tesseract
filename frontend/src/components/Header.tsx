          <p>"Every business uses their own system for compliance & health and safety so the supply chain has to do something different on every job — that leads to tens if not hundreds of different systems for an SME to learn and do."</p>
          <p>There is no increase or improvement in productivity as every time you have to do something different there is a drag on your time.</p>
          <p>The cost becomes ridiculous as companies have to buy a different system, train people on each system and time = money</p>
